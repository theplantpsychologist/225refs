paper.js is ok but another option is svg.js or pixi.js or just raw html canvas

To host the server, type in the terminal (aka command prompt):
    python3 -m http.server 8000
Then, in the browser, go to 
    http://localhost:8000/

To host this for easier public access when finished, we could host through github. I could also host it through MIT
