Notes (for developers, notes for users goes in the readme)

paper.js is ok but another option is svg.js

To host the server, type in the terminal:
    python3 -m http.server 8000
Then, in the browser, go to 
    http://localhost:8000/

To host this for easier public access when finished, I believe github has some free hosting but idk how to do it. I could also host it through MIT
